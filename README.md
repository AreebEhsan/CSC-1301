# CS1301
The course delved into fundamental programming concepts, including variables, data types, control structures, and functions. As I progressed, the complexity of the programs I tackled increased, allowing me to build a diverse skill set. This documentation serves as a testament to my progress, and I'm excited to continue expanding my programming skills in future courses and projects.
